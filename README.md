## Tone Notation

The notation used in the _Thai Charts_ specifies the _lexical_ tone but not necessarily the actual curve of the articulated tone. There are some variations in the specified curves out there when Chao tone letters and numerals are used. The aim of the _Thai Charts_ is that the tone notation can easily be read and that the tones can easily be identified and distinguished from one another.
